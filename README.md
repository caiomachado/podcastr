# Project done during Next Level Week (NLW) 5th Edition brought by RocketSeat.

The goal was to create a podcast app where you're able to play podcasts.
These podcasts come from a fake API, but if integrated with a real API could be very thorough since we have all the player functionalities such as shuffle, repeat, pause, play, next and previous and so on.

Technologies used: Next.js, React.js, Sass, Json Server and TypeScript.
There were some dependencies used as well for date such as date-fns and for the progress bar (slider component) rc-slider.
